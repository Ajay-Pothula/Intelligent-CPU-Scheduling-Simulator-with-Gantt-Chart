# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduling-Simulator-with-Gantt-Chart
The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a web based website that is designed to understand about the CPU scheduling algorithms such as (First Come First Served, SJF, Priority Scheduling and Round Robin) in a visual way using Gantt chart and other performance metrics. The main aim of the project is to give knowledge to students, educators and other OS-enthusiased people about the working of scheduling algo’s with the enchanced performance metrics. This provides real time visualization using gantt chart. Allowing user to enter the inputs iof Arrival time(AT) and Burst time (BT) and enables him to visualize the other performance metrics like Completion Time(CT), Waiting Time(WT), TurnAroundTime(TAT), with the averages like Avg TAT, Avg WT. Round robin algo asks user for time slices and makes him see the time quantum enabled Gantt Chart. 
This CPU Scheduling Simulator allows user to input arrival time and burst time and helps him/her to visualize Gantt Chart also required tables for performance.
This project typically covers the following scheduling algorithms :
1) First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First (SJF)
3) Priority Scheduling
4) Round Robin (RR)
Gantt Chart Visualization – Displays the order in which processes are executed.
Performance Calculation :
Turnaround Time (TAT) = Completion Time - Arrival Time
Waiting Time (WT) = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
Response Time (RT) = First Execution Start Time - Arrival Time
CPU Utilization and Throughput

Technologoies Used are 
HTML and CSS for the User interface 
JavaScript for the working of algorithms

Libraries and Tools:
•	Javascript DOM manipulation : Dynamically updating the tables and Gantt chart based on the inputs entered by the user.
•	Canvas API and CSS flexbox : Used for making the gantt chart in a structured and very large manner.
•	Event Listeners :  Handles the user interaction like the scheduling, processing and process inputs.
•	Visualization : The user can see what he has already entered the inputs in a process table that can show AT, BT and Priority entered by the user.
•	Tailwind CSS : Enhanced UI responsiveness and styling used in this cause of making it easy to implement.
•	JavaScript : Implemengts scheduling logic and UI  and real time data visualizations.
•	HTML5 : Structuring web interface, and the input forms, process tables and gantt charts.
•	CSS3 : Styling of the simulator, making it very user friendly and styling using hover for buttons.

Scope Conclusion:
The intelligent CPU scheduler provides real time interactive visualization of the spu schediuling algorithms, helping to understand and evaluate performance metrics.
Implementation of other CPU scheduling algorithms, like SJF in preemptive and MLFQ(Multi-Level-Feedback-Queue) and some rate and dead monotonic. 
Real Time gantt chart visualization. Performance metrics calculation and UI updates.

The Intelligent CPU scheduling simulator successfully simulates and visualizes  the cpu scheduling algorithms. It helps users analyse various scheduling techniques by displaying through performance metrics nad gantt chart visualization. Thus serving as a educational tool for students, professionals and other educational experts.

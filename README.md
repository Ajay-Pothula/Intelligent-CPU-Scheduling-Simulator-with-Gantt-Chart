# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduling-Simulator-with-Gantt-Chart
This CPU Scheduling Simulator allows user to input arrival time and burst time and helps him/her to visualize Gantt Chart also required tables for performance.
This project typically covers the following scheduling algorithms :
1) First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First (SJF)
3) Priority Scheduling
4) Round Robin (RR)
Gantt Chart Visualization â€“ Displays the order in which processes are executed.
Performance Calculation :
Turnaround Time (TAT) = Completion Time - Arrival Time
Waiting Time (WT) = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
Response Time (RT) = First Execution Start Time - Arrival Time
CPU Utilization and Throughput

Technologoies Used are 
HTML and CSS for the User interface 
JavaScript for the working of algorithms
